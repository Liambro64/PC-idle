# PC Idle
PC Idle is a game I am working on in Unity, and have been for a while. I recently overhauled ~60% of my code to go from predefined locations within the game to Windows, like the browser you are viewing this in. Still very very very much a WIP, but I am heavily invested and spend most (and if not, all) of my time working on this or other projects.
## Direction
Well, its an incremental game and not done whatsoever, but I am working towards a goal of playability every day.
